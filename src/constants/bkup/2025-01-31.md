## At FOSDEM Social Web

This Saturday (Feb 1) I will give a talk about Elk at FOSDEM 2025 Social Web dev room!

Thereâ€™s plenty to talk about in the Social Web space, and the line up looks really interesting! Particularly looking forward to hearing about Federation @ Forgejo ðŸ˜„

Glad to be part of this. See you if youâ€™re there!
