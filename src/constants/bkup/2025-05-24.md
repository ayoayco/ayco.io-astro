As a weekend project, I have set up my old "gaming" laptop as an Ubuntu server to run services under my fancy new domain [ayo.run](https://ayo.run) (could be blocked by enterprise firewalls).

The computer is sitting inside the water meter cabinet at home, and I route it through [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) which gives me the protection while exposing it to the Internet without a public IP address. It's like magic.

Very happy with this because it is way more powerful than the VPS (Virtual Private Server) I am renting for [ayco.io](https://ayco.io) stuff, but I am practically paying zero aside from the usual the electricity, internet bills.

I am posting updates about the project on this [thread](https://ayo.ayco.io/threads/114490408596372783).

By hosting more polished web applications created by active open source communities, I learn different approaches on how people build stuff and am now able to consider them for my own projects. 🎉

I have plans to make [cozy.pub](https://cozy.pub) easily self-hostable when I get to building more features for it.
