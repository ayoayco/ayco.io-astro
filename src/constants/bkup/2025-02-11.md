The video recording for my talk about Elk at the Social Web FOSDEM is out:

ðŸ‘‰ https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5049-elk-a-nimble-client-for-mastodon/

As of writing, the audio still not synced, but I was informed that it _might_ get fixed after a reencode pass thingy.

(Just squint your eyes for now, or if you get annoyed check again later)

## Update: I fixed the video

See my [blog post on this talk](https://ayos.blog/elk-fosdem-2025/).
