I have moved main activities (e.g, repository, planned work, announcements/discussions) on my projects to [SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org) â€” a *code forge* much like GitHub, GitLab or Codeberg, but with significant differences.

The projects are still automatically mirrored to GitHub using automatic `git push --mirror` via [SourceHut Builds](https://builds.sr.ht).
