Happy with how I organized my spaces at home with separation for *creating* and *consuming* stuff, after [realizing](https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/113753532411548490) that [*I like it that way*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fndeDfaWCg).

Meaning, in my workspace where I usually create stuff (e.g., software, music, write-ups) it feels weird to be consuming media (e.g., books, games, files).

Enjoying this so far. I now have a reading corner, a gaming corner, a music corner, and my usual work area (which is the biggest).

I have [received news](https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/113759677401894023) that my proposal to talk about [Elk](https://elk.zone) in [FOSDEM2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/) was accepted.

Fingers-crossed they send me the schedule for the slot soon. So glad that I will be participating in topics I am most passionate about: The freedom of people in the Web and the efforts to protect it using Free and Open Source Software.

I have also published [a new page](/tech-bsky-fedi) ðŸŽ‰ in celebration of Bsky accounts who opted to bridge their presense in the Fediverse. Hoping to get more Bsky accounts to do that...

Overall, after 3 winters here in The Netherlands, I feel like I have adjusted well already to find my rhythm. Looking forward to a great 2025!
