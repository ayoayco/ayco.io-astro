## Reading

Books I'm currently reading as I continue to have a messed up health & rhythm

- [Getting Real](https://books.37signals.com/8/getting-real)
- [How to Read a Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book)
- [Code Complete 2](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735619670/)
- [The Mythical Man-Month](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201835959/)

## Something to look forward to

Reading has been a great companion lately. [37signals](https://37signals.com/) inspired me while reading their book "Getting Real", just in time as I'm up for updating my vision for 2030, after achieving most of my 2025 targets. [I want to start a cooperative that will empower people to take ownership of their digital lives.](https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/114655020696985932).
