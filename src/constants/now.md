# FOSDEM 2025

Just today, I got a notification via mail that I've been added to a [Matrix]() chat room for social web "backstage" -- I thought it was strange because I was not in the schedule the last several times I checked. So I visited the [page for the day's schedule](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/social-web/) and apparently I'm included.

Not sure what happened, it could be a glitch in the conference planning platform or the communication, but yeah, I'm going to [FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025) for a short talk about [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk).

If you are going, please [drop me a line via any of my contact channels](https://ayco.io/about) and let's meet. :)
