I have not been on top of things lately.

I think this has been going on for weeks, if not months, already? I am not in a good spot personally, and I don't have much headspace.

I’m dropping a lot of balls, which means unusual things outside of my routines are the first to fall. Some “side stuff” (like open source, community participation, etc) are taking a backseat,

Family takes priority right now. And I’m happy in that area because we are okay despite how this not being a good season for us.

But overall I am hopeful in that I think I will come out stronger when this is done. Happy to be surrounded by supportive folks. 

There you go. Not all updates are butterflies & rainbows. 

## In other news

To make things less awkard, I'll end with some positive stuff. Here are a few tech news that happened recently which weirdly gives me the sense they could have a domino-effect towards a good direction
