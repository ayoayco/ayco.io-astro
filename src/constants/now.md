## Annual Sickness

I have been on bed rest for some days now due to fevers and coughs. This is tough on my real day job, since my work now is mostly meetings -- my mind blanks out a lot and coughing does not help. Hoping to get better soon and come back refreshed.

## McFly progress

Had a good progress on [McFly](https://mcfly.js.org) -- the codebase is so clean now:
1. only need one config file now `mcfly.config.mjs`
2.  `api` routes are now inside `src/` (so no need for a `routes/api`)
3.  No need for the catch-all route in `routes/[...].js`

Try it today by runing: `npm create mcfly@latest`

## Ghosted by Social Web organizers for FOSDEM2025

I have received an [acceptance letter](https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/113759677401894023) for my Elk talk proposal, but [was not given a slot](https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/113784915020626878) in the end... I wonder how common of a practice is this among conference organizers. But yeah, I am not going to FOSDEM2025.

## Chat poll

I opened a [poll](https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/113775644091515266) asking which chat platforms are popular. Discord is quite popular; a lot of open source projects are managing their communities there.
