<p>I did not want to, but I started and can't stop watching! The first season was an absolute masterpiece, this second season is... I don't know how to say it best... it has been a loooong while since I was this absorbed in a story. It's epic, well-written, gripping, unpredictably good. Music is perfect. Ah, five stars is not enough I think. :)</p>
<h2>Playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake for PC</a></h2>
<p>I am in the 8th chapter (I think) and what I like about this one is that it is so arcade-y it is easy to pick up and understand without thinking about it too much. Right amount of hack-and-slash combat and tactics (choosing skills &#x26; items to use for party members, switching between them, etc.)</p>
<h2>This is progress</h2>
<p>After COVID and emigrating to The Netherlands (a different story by itself), I don't think I ever really had the headspace to enjoy these things. It's weird. I have been trying, but even watching a movie is not really enjoyable.</p>
<p>I think me being able to enjoy watching series and a game like this is progress. 2021 has caused a huge adjustment for me (bordering trauma). And I feel that this "progress" is further indication that I am recovering.</p>`
