    <h1><span class="text-gradient">Now</span></h1>
    <p>
      <em>Published on the <time datetime="2024-09-05">5th of September, 2024</time> from my home in Amsterdam, where it is starting to get colder again :)</em>
    </p>
    <p><em>This is a dump of what my current state, more or less, and I plan to update my Now pages in a similar manner and more frequently...</em></p>
    <p>
      I took the first week of September off. ”Shallow” Vacation: making time for things I have neglected in a while. Reconsidering my goals & productivity systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reconsidered my phone usage as well: The apple watch is good enough for quick notes — which is the main driver for keeping my phone around. I'm using <em>Things 3</em>. The watch is good for this (especially at night) because doesn’t have the distractions of my phone. My “phone” is rarely even used as phone (why don’t we just call them palmtops?)

      Happy about my mokka pot coffee-making journey. Been making consistent espresso flavor that I really like for a while. Now considering to start learning other variants like cappuccino

      Bought a Dyson air purifier: https://www.dyson.com/air-treatment/air-purifier-heaters/purifier-hot-cool-formaldehyde-hp09/white-gold
    </p>

      Been updating Cozy, and it has a new ”permanent” address: https://cozy.pub -- See further thought on this project: https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/113079696909950984
    Just give me a hundred years to finish this :)
    </p>
    <p>
      The reality of having a new role for work is hitting, and I wanna learn more how to succeed in engineering leadership. I’m taking my time this off-work week to reassess my leadership style, our strategies at work and how my vision for the web fits
