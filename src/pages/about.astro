        Hey there! I interrupt this page for a message from this website's
        sponsor...
      </summary>
      <p>
        <strong>Myself!</strong> Thank you for wanting to read a bit more about me.
        <!--Some people shy away from writing things about themselves, and thus looks negatively at others who do. But that shouldn't be the case!-->
        I find it helpful to have a single canonical <code class="inline-code"
          >/about</code
        > page with these significant information. It is always a work in progress
        (like me), and to be honest, I do this mostly to remind myself as the world
        continue to impose identity onto us. Cheers to celebrating differences!

    <p>
      I am a newbie engineering manager at a large global bank headquartered in
      Amsterdam. I'm also a certified software architecture professional
      (CPSA‑F®) by <a href="https://isaqb.org" target="_blank">isaqb.org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time, when I have energy, I find it fun building <a
        href="/showcase">hobby projects</a
      >, running self-hosted services at <a href="https://ayo.run">ayo.run</a>,
      and volunteering to <a
        href="https://ayos.blog/why-fediverse/"
        target="_blank">Fediverse</a
      > projects like <a href="https://elk.zone">elk.zone</a>,
      <a href="https://m.webtoo.ls/public/local">webtoo.ls</a>, and <a
        href="https://m.webtoo.ls/@vitest">vitest's fedi presence</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a previous life, I've volunteered much of my weekends into teaching
      kids, leading small groups of students, planting a church, and
      facilitating focus group discussions with entrepreneurial founders, where
      I learned a lot about the power of multi-generational & multi-cultural
      communities.
